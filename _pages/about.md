Hello! Iâ€™m Hoyath Ali, a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a> ðŸŽ“, with 3 years of experience in machine learning. My career has involved developing systems to enhance financial security and optimize clinical trial protocols.

Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning and deep learning, focusing on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and exploring retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). My technical skill set includes Python, JavaScript, and frameworks such as <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/">Transformers</a>. I also have hands-on experience with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> for real-time model monitoring and deployment.
