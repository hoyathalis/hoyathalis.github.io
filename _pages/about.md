Hello! I’m Hoyath Ali, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>, with 3 years of industry experience in machine learning. My journey in technology includes notable experience at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a>, where I developed systems to enhance financial security and operational efficiency.

Currently, I’m focusing on leveraging my expertise to tackle complex problems in machine learning and AI. My technical skill set includes proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and various machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Transformers. I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS and tools for real-time model monitoring and deployment, including Docker and Kubernetes. My work has involved developing systems to enhance financial security, optimize clinical trial protocols, and assist with no-code logic analysis.
