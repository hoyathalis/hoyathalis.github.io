- title: "Phi AI for Low/No Code (Pega)"
  date: "Aug-2024"
  description: "Phi AI for Pega is a Chrome extension that leverages two key functionalities: it analyzes critical business logic in Pega, identifying and resolving issues in activities and data transforms to prevent production failures, and it also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone to answer Pega domain-specific questions. This combination enhances development efficiency by streamlining workflows, improving code quality, and offering instant insights."

- title: "Trading Agent using Reinforcement Learning"
  date: "June-2024"
  description: "This project works on developing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) trading agent designed for continuous action spaces. We focus on algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic, which are well-suited for such environments. Additionally, we design optimized reward functions and state representations to capture key financial metrics and market dynamics, enabling the agent to learn effective trading strategies."

- title: "Accelarating general-purpose applications using NN"
  date: "March-2024"
  description: "Parrot Transformation implements a neural network-based approach to accelerate general-purpose grayscale transformation functions. By replacing traditional methods with a neural network, the project achieves up to a 30% increase in inference speed using GPU and TPU accelerators. The model demonstrates high accuracy (90%) in emulating the original function, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse applications and emphasizing the practical benefits of hardware acceleration."
